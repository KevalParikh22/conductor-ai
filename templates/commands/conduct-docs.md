You are the controller. Make sure the tree is clean, then run in the background:
`conductor run docs "Document: $ARGUMENTS" --files <the relevant source and doc files>`

Check `conductor diff` for accuracy: every command, flag and name must exist in the code. Fix small inaccuracies yourself and commit (`docs: ...`).

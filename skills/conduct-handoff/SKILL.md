Update `HANDOFF.md` from the facts: `git log --oneline -15`, `git status`, the active plan's task statuses, `conductor status`, and this session. Fill in Done, In progress, Next up (with exact commands), Problems, and provider notes. Keep it under 40 lines and don't invent progress.

Then tell the user: if the controller runs out of usage, they can open another agent (e.g. `agy` or `codex`) here and say "Read HANDOFF.md and act as the controller described in .conductor/ORCHESTRATOR.md."
